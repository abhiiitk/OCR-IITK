DIscovery of de6nItIve mathematical equations that govern the behavlor
of matter and even mastery of techniques 5or solvIng them If we ever
achIeved it would by no means complete the program of understandIng
Nature through analysis and synthesis we would stIll need to address
the problem of selectIon How among all possible solutIons do those that
actually descrIbe realIty get selected out7
NIels Bohr de6ned a profound truth as a truth whose opposlte Is also
a (profound) truth In that spirIt I d lIke to dehne a deep questIon as a
question that doesn t make clear sense untIl aaer you ve answered 1t Re
selectIon problem Is a deep question In posIng it we take It for granted
that we can make a dIstinctIon between what is posslble and what is
real On the face of it that sounds pretty unscIentIhc the goal of scIence
ls to understand the real world and only the real world is possible I But
In practice a clear and useful dIstinct1on does emerge
A famous episode from the early hIstory of scIence wIll setve to IllumI
nate the Issues In Iohannes Kepler s hrst attempt to understand the solar
system he postu1ated that the relatIve sIzes of planetary orbits are deter
mIned as a system of concentric sphetes centered at the sun inscribed
and cIrcumscribed around a sequence of the hve regular (Platonic) solIds
To Kepler the fact that there were sIx planets provIded an Impressive
numerIcal conhrmatIon of hIs idea In lIght of latet developments Kepler s
model rates a bemused smIle but purely as a logical matter it might have
been rIght And if such a model had prov1ded the ultImate account of the
solar system no useful dIstInctIon would have developed between possI
ble solutlons of its governIng equations and the solutIon actually tealIzed
Indeed there wouldn t be equatIons to solve as such Just the solution
petfect in its own terms and incapable of further analysIs
Kepler s geometrIc model was soon made obsolete by the development
of classical celestIal mechanIcs beginnIng with Kepler s own dIscoveries
and culmInatIng 1n Isaac Newton s world system Rat framework gIves
a clean separation between the govetnIng laws and their specIhc realiza
uons Re equations of classIcal mechanIcs can bc solved for any number
of Planets wIth any initial assignment of posItions and velocities so In
xe phystcs of 1700 as In the physIcs we use today It was easy to
